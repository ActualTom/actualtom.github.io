intro: |
  I am a technology leader and accomplished author with over 24 years experience. I have worked in a variety of roles, from working on an IT Helpdesk to managing one, to working as a network architect and systems administrator. I worked in the US Navy as a Director of IT for a schoolhouse that served over 3,500 combined staff and students, and currently am the Senior Director of Security Operations at DigiCert, the global leader in digital trust.<br/><br/>
  I enjoy building not only with technology, like cyber ranges, but I really enjoy building processes that work - bringing order to chaos, and establishing 'systems' and programs.  I see the bigger picture, communicate across cross-functional teams, and "get stuff done."  I focus on first-time quality while also meeting the business needs on time. I hate seeing the same mistake happen multiple times, and pride myself on making processes that not only work for me, but for my whole team. I thrive on root cause analysis and continuous improvement.<br/><br/>
  In my free time, I enjoy time with my family, taking care of our acreage and home, and backpacking throughout the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest.

   <strong>Skills</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management. I have built range networks from the ground up, directly influencing the UI/UX and experience, as well as the architecture, on Google Cloud and VMWare.  As I stated above, I enjoy seeing the bigger picture, communicating across the various business units, creating order out of chaos, and getting stuff done.  Thanks for tuning in and checking this out!
